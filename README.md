# Australian News AI Dashboard

An intelligent news aggregation system that scrapes articles from major Australian news sources, applies AI-powered classification and similarity detection, and presents the most important stories through smart prioritization. The system extracts content from ABC News, The Guardian Australia, Sydney Morning Herald, and News.com.au across sports, finance, lifestyle, and music categories. Using advanced algorithms, it identifies breaking news, clusters related articles across sources, and ranks stories by importance using multi-factor scoring. The platform provides both traditional article browsing and an enhanced "Smart News Discovery" feature that surfaces the top 10 most significant stories with comprehensive metadata and priority analysis.
